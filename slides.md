# What can you expect from this talk?

We're going to talk about Vue (well duh...) by discussing the following topics:

- 🙋‍♂️ **Who am I?** - And why should you even listen to me in the first place
- 🧑‍💻 **My experience** - spoiler alert: it has been great so far :)
- 🗝️ **Key concepts** - Nothing too fancy, just an overview and framework comparison
- 🤑 **Benefits** - The actual love part
- 😪 **Challenges** - What's love without a little hate?
- 🗂️ **A survey** - What do Infraspeak developers think?
- ❓ **Q/A** - Make me look smart
